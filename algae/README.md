Algal Bloom in Artificial Water sources 
Obtained the data source from : https://www.kaggle.com/code/rafaymemon/algae-growth-in-artificial-water-bodies/input

There are two jupyter notebooks called Class_Conversion.ipynb and Splitting_Algae.ipynb
1. Class_Conversion.ipynb - The code converts the last column of class labels in the original CSV file to numeric values based on the specified conversion logic, and then it saves the updated data into a new CSV file.
2. Splitting_Algae.ipynb - The code effectively loads the previously modified dataset, splits it into training and testing sets (80% for training and 20% for testing), saves those sets into separate CSV files.
3. The output files obtained are:
algae_train.csv and algae_test.csv
